Additional Information:

For API calling, you can choose between using RTK Query or Axios based on your preference.
Implement aliasing, follow the best practices and guidelines outlined below:
Utilize useMemo for memoizing values to optimize performance.
Use useCallback to memoize event handlers and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Wrap components in React.memo to leverage memoization for functional components.
By incorporating these practices, you can enhance the efficiency and performance of your React Native application. If you require further details or have any specific questions, feel free to ask!
